# ISS Data Visualizer
This is a data graphing script for my Interdiciplainary Studies of Science class at school. A published version is available [here](http://yoerik.com/ISSDataVisualization/).  It uses data that was cleaned up using my [data validator](https://github.com/widakay/ISS-Data-Validator).
